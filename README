Rename File Extension - A C# application tool for renaming files extension.


Description:

I usually develop application on Mac OS, but most of my client are using Windows.
When my clients sent me a bunch of images, audio or video files, they didn't realize that there files extension are inconsistent.(e.g. JPG, Jpg , MP3, mp3). 

It's ok for me to make my application support different cases, but I want to keep my app fast and dealing with string conversion isn't something that it should spend time on.
 
This tool make my life easier. :)
