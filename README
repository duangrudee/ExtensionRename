Rename File Extension - A C# application tool for renaming files extension.


History:
I usually develop application on Mac OS, but most of my client are using Windows.
When my clients sent me a bunch of images, audio or video files, they didn't realize that there files extension are inconsistent.(e.g. JPG, Jpg , MP3, mp3). 

It's ok for me to make my application support different cases, but I want to keep my app fast and dealing with string conversion isn't something that it should spend time on.
 
This tool make my life easier. :)

Description:
This is a Windows app, it requires .NET framework 2.0 or higher.
To run this tool on Mac, use mono. (see http://www.mono-project.com/)

How to use:
1. Enter the folder that contains the files you want to rename.
2. Enter the original extension of the files (without dot) such as JPG
3. And enter the new file extension (without dot) such ash jpg
4. Click start
5. The files will be renamed and move to the folder 'output' inside your source folder.
